# Heart Disease Prediction App

## Overview
This app leverages a Machine Learning (ML) model to predict heart disease based on medical inputs. It is built using TensorFlow and scikit-learn, employing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network which is optimized and evaluated to ensure high accuracy and performance.

## Model Development and Evaluation

### Features
- **Model Creation**: The MLP model includes multiple dense layers and uses regularization to prevent overfitting.
- **Training**: Optimally trained on a dataset with carefully selected hyperparameters for the best performance.
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are provided along with confusion matrix and classification reports.

## Pipeline Creation

### Functions
- Python functions encapsulate all steps of the ML pipeline, ensuring code modularity and reusability.
- **Retraining Mechanism**: A robust and well-documented mechanism for retraining the model with new data is included.

## Submission and Documentation

### GitHub Repository Structure
1. **README.md**: Provides detailed instructions for setting up and running the project.
2. **Model Files**: Includes Jupyter notebooks (`heart_disease_prediction.ipynb`) and Python scripts (`models.py`, `predictions.py`), detailing the model's development and deployment.
3. **Deployment Files**: Contains all necessary configurations for deploying the model on a cloud platform.
4. **URL**: Link to the deployed app (https://heart-disease-prediction-vpfrju28z6dlmfxymaeg9q.streamlit.app/).

## Deployment

- **Cloud Platform**: The ML pipeline is deployed on a cloud platform, ensuring scalability and easy access. The deployment is consistent with the development in the notebook and pipeline files.
